# Working with String
# =================================
# Storing Strings in variable

Name = "Sam"
State = "Texas"

# print(Name, State)
# print("His name is " + Name + " his from " + State)


# Using F-Strings / format
# print(f"His name is {Name} and his from {State}.")


# # String Concatenation
firstname = "Sam"
lastname = "Davies"
fullname = firstname + " " +lastname
# print(fullname)



# # String methods:
# # use dir() to see all the method you can use with string
# print(dir(str))

# # Example 1
# print(fullname.lower())

# # Example 2
# fruits ="Apple Mango strawberry"
# print(fruits.split(" "))
