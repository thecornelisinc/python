# Working with Operations

x = 10
y = 3

# 1. Addition 
result = x + y
# print(result)


# 2. Subtraction
result = x - y
# print(result)


# 3. Division
# result = x / y
# print(result)

# 3. multiplication
# result = x * y
# print(result)


# 4. Modulus
# This is used to find the remainder
# result = x % y
# print(result)



# 4. Exponentiation
# This is used to find the remainder
# result = x ** y
# print(result)

# 4. Floor division
# This is used to find the remainder
result = x // y
print(result)
